# RustSandbox
A sandbox for Rust experiments. I plan to experiment with the barebones of new Rust libraries and frameworks here, and then use them in actual project repositories. This is for learning, and the code is not polished, though you may find an example you can lift and use.

# Examples

# Running an example

First, chmod +x ./run

Then, ./run <example name> <example args>

For example,  ./run onepagecms
